# NESTChemicalJU---CODA-NS
CODA‑NS: Neuro‑symbolic data‑flow agent for clinical trials. A Python logic kernel enforces deterministic, FDA‑aligned safety rules, harmonizes heterogeneous EDC and laboratory sources, computes real‑time risk states (Clean/High/Critical), and conditions LLM narration to yield auditable, low‑latency intervention guidance.
